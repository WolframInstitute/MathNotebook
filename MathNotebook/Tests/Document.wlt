(* LaTeXPaperImport T2. The document layer above the math converter: \section/\subsection/
   \subsubsection and theorem-like environments become cells of the corresponding style, and come
   back out as the environment names the source used. Everything it does not convert — lists,
   figures, front matter — is carried verbatim, and every cell records the whitespace that followed
   it in the source, so the export of an imported document is the source byte for byte. *)
