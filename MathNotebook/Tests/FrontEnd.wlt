(* The other test files are kernel-only and stub every chain read. This one is the opposite on
   purpose: both defects in ViewAndReferenceDefects passed their unit tests and still shipped
   broken, because "the call wrote an override cell" is not "the style changed size". Everything
   here is measured through a real front end and a real stylesheet chain, so the assertions are the
   reproductions Pavel reported rather than restatements of the code.

   The sheets are embedded with Get rather than named: a paclet stylesheet resolved by name has
   been seen to fall back to Default.nb in a headless run, so every measurement asserts the sheet
   really loaded before it is trusted. While a view override is installed, the private sheet's
   parent is an embedded notebook, and styles it does NOT override then fall through to Default.nb
   — harmless here because every style asserted is one the override writes. *)

(* T2: the same assertion one level up. A display environment glued into a paragraph is now split
   into its own cell, so what has to be shown is that the formula really renders and that the
   starred form really is unnumbered. The equation number is a CounterBox and a single rasterized
   cell has no document context to resolve one — both starred and unstarred measured 243 that way —
   so both halves render the whole notebook.

   LaTeXPaperImport T12: a whole-notebook render and a single-cell Rasterize are not on the same
   scale and must never be compared. So every number that appears on both sides of a comparison
   below comes from notebookInk, "Literal" included; the one cell raster left, "Formula", is only
   ever asked whether it is positive. notebookInk takes the notebook rather than the source text,
   so the unconverted paragraph goes through exactly the same measurement as the converted one.
   The appearance is the second half of "the same way", and it takes BOTH options: inkOf counts every
   pixel that is not white, so on a dark appearance an unpinned background counts the whole canvas as
   ink — and Background -> White alone then leaves the prose drawn in the dark appearance's light
   foreground, on white, so a Text cell measures exactly 0 and every comparison against it inverts.
   That is what it did here, silently, until ConversionUX T2; with LightDark -> "Light" beside it the
   paragraph reads 2440 and the two formulas 1268 and 1368, which is what this file always claimed.
   (WindowSize is not pinned because it cannot be — the export
   crops to the content, so the width follows the text and the ink is unaffected by the wrap.)

   "Formula" reads 0 when no DisplayFormula cell was produced at all, rather than measuring what
   FirstCase returned: rasterizing a bare Missing["NotFound"] draws the words and carries 653 ink,
   so "Formula > 0" was passing on a paragraph the converter had left entirely alone. *)

   island is styled "InlineFormula" now, and this measures the wiring end to end rather than the cells
   the control generates: View.wlt asserts those, and the ViewAndReferenceDefects lesson is that such
   assertions pass while the rendered result is wrong.

   Two claims, not one. The inline mathematics must GROW when the control is turned up, and it must
   come back on reset. The prose is measured beside it as a control: the *document* control was not

(* FirstReadingDefects T5: the confirmed model, measured on the page in all four slider states.

   The measurement is the exported image's WIDTH, and that is not a stylistic choice. A display
   formula's width is exactly linear in its size — "x + y" exports 26, 51, 77 and 103 px at 13, 26, 39
   and 52 pt — so width IS a size reading, where ink is not (it grows about as size^1.5, so an ink
   comparison across two sizes needs a tolerance nobody can justify) and height is not (the enclosing
   text cell's line-height floor holds an island of 6.5 pt to a 14 px line, which is exactly how the
   squared-ratio defect stayed hidden).

   Every state drags the TEXT slider, the base state to the sheet's own size. That is what makes the
   four comparable: with no override at all the export does not crop horizontally, and — the reason
   that matters more — a private sheet's parent here is an embedded notebook, so any style the sheet
   does not itself write falls through to Default.nb. An island's size is its host cell's size times a
   ratio, so a state that leaves Text unwritten cannot be measured at all. Dragging the text slider to
   13 writes every style at its own base size, which is a real state (scale 1, not Automatic) and not a
   contrivance.

   Three claims. Inline mathematics must sit at the sheet's own ratio to DISPLAY mathematics in every
   state — that is the whole of the fix, and it fails in three of the four states under the shipped
   arithmetic (2.19, 6.7 and 2.19 against 1.10). The text slider must carry display mathematics with
   it, which it did not. And an explicit math size must override that rather than compound with it. *)

   Pavel reported a cross-reference rendering in a different face from the label it points at, and the

   sheet is 406 ink at height 15 as inline TextData, which is the prose face exactly (409/15), and 482
   at height 17 as BoxData, because BoxData renders in the box face. Writing at a cell-bracket
   selection produced exactly that BoxData cell AND destroyed the cell's content, so the wrong font and

(* Every group below is measured in a front end of ITS OWN, and two facts make that possible that
   are not what this file assumed (FrontEndTestIsolation T1, both measured):

   - UsingFrontEnd does NOT give a new front end. Two sequential blocks in one kernel report the
     IDENTICAL LinkObject, so a second UsingFrontEnd — the obvious fix, and the one this item was
     written to make — isolates exactly nothing.
   - Developer`UninstallFrontEnd[] is the teardown that does. Measured over four rounds the link
     goes 106 -> 109 -> 112 -> 115, each one fresh and each one answering. LinkClose on $FrontEnd is
     NOT that teardown: it leaves the kernel unable to launch another, and the next UsingFrontEnd
     then HANGS forever, with no message, uninterruptible by TimeConstrained because a blocked
     MathLink read does not take an abort. That is the wedge that stopped S1, and the two calls are
     one line apart.

   What the split buys is that a front end killed by one group cannot take the rest of the file with
   it, which is what a single association did: with all 34 entries in one, the service front end died
   somewhere among them.

   Two corrections to that last sentence, both T2 and both measured. A front end that dies is
   RELAUNCHED transparently, so exactly ONE measurement is damaged per death — the one whose export
   was in flight — rather than every measurement after it; the eleven renderers ran correctly on the
   fresh link. And Length @ Notebooks[] therefore answers 1 straight across a death, which is what
   made the death look like a mystery: the only reading that detects one is the LinkObject's own id
   changing, and MathLink`LinkConnectedQ answers False even on a healthy link. Which entry does the
   killing is named at "Default" below. *)
(* T3. A front end that dies takes its measurement's value down with it, and what that value then
   reaches is an assertion expecting a string — so the failure is reported as a CONTENT MISMATCH about
   the paclet, which is exactly what happened to BibliographyHeading and what got it written off twice
   as an environment artifact. The two readings that detect a death are the LinkObject's own id
   changing (T2: Length @ Notebooks[] answers 1 straight across one, and MathLink`LinkConnectedQ
   answers False on a HEALTHY link, so neither detects anything) and a $Failed surfacing in a stored
   value — no measurement in this file records a $Failed legitimately, the one place that could
   (splitCitationFinds) mapping it to None at the source. Either one aborts the whole file with a
   named message, because a corpse is not worth testing and a green-but-for-one run here is not a
   baseline. *)
(* A message string is a StringForm template, so a BACKTICK in it is a slot: quoting the recovery
   shell commands in markdown backticks — as the rest of this repo's prose does — made the message
   demand items 0 and 5 and print StringForm::sfr twice before the real text. No backticks here. *)
frontEndGroup::died = "The service front end did not survive the \"`1`\" measurement group. Link id before/after: `2` -> `3` (a CHANGE is a death; equal ids with a $Failed below means the front end answered but the measurement did not). Measurements carrying $Failed: `4`. Every assertion downstream of this is about a dead front end and NOT about the paclet -- do not read a content mismatch in Tests/FrontEnd.wlt as one, and do not attribute it to machine load without naming the TestID first. Recover with: defaults write com.wolfram.WolframApp ApplePersistenceIgnoreState -bool true ; pkill -9 -f MathematicaServer ; then a trivial UsingFrontEnd[ 1 + 1 ]. See CLAUDE.md, Build & test.

(* FirstReadingDefects T5. The sheet's own ratio is 1.05 and a relative FontSize renders at its square,
   so the wanted proportion of inline to display mathematics is 1.05^2 = 1.1025 — measured 1.077, 1.118,
   1.104 and 1.077 across the four states, the spread being one pixel of quantization at these sizes.
   The tolerance is 10%, which admits every one of those and excludes all three failures of the shipped
   arithmetic by a wide margin. Asserting the ratio rather than the sizes is the point: it is a claim
   about the two kinds of mathematics agreeing, and it holds whatever the sliders are set to. *)

   display formula — it used to leave it exactly where it was, which is what reads as the equations
   having been left behind — and an explicit math size at the anchor puts it back to its base width
   whatever the text slider is doing, so the override is an override and not a second factor. The
   widths are exact rather than compared: "x + y" is 26 px at 13 pt and 51 at 26, the odd pixel being
   the glyph advance and not slack in the claim. *)
